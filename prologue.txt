You are a slice of ninja toast

Your god-like speed, dexterity, jumping power and reflexes are the result of real butter.  Sadly, your natural lifetime is only 15 minutes.

Like all ninja toast you must quest for immortality, by collecting slices of melon.

You are guided thus by a devout belief in T.

T, "The way of the true butter brotherhood" is an ancient and advanced art of physical and spiritual training.  T emphasises pacifim, melns and the need to traverse incresingly complicated rooms guarded by lethal toast killing guards.
